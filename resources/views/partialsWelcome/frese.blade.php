            <h3>Manage the cost of you water</h3>

            <p>Frese BYPASS provides deep insight into your district energy network, allowing you to optimize energy efficiency by lowering temperature and reducing pressure.</p>
            <p>Controlling the flow in your district energy network no longer needs to be a guessing game. With the new bypass solution from Danish valve manufacturer Frese you will be able to monitor, operate and control your systems remotely, thereby ensuring significant savings on energy as well as on your bottom line.</p>
            <p>Frese BYPASS consists of an old favorite: The Frese OPTIMA Compact PICV, which is a pressure independent control valve, and a new, intelligent and battery operated controller, which enables remote operation of the valve.</p>

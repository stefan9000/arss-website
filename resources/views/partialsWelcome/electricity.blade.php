            <p>Electric meters measure usage. That’s their job. But that’s so…one-dimensional.</p>
            <p>The Stratus IQ meter takes measurement to a whole new level by monitoring and providing feedback through enhanced data. This meter was designed to provide utilities with the data visibility and control needed to quickly adapt to a rapidly evolving smart grid.</p>
            <p>Building upon the best-in-class Stratus® metering platform, the Stratus IQ combines grid edge intelligence with precise energy measurement into one powerful package. This meter provides two-way counting and options for high or low granularity of reads. Plus, with high-precision voltage monitoring and outage alarms, the Stratus IQ has the intelligence to deliver smart better.</p>
            <p>Not only does this next-gen meter give utilities commercial and industrial power in a residential meter, it’s also obsessively designed and tested to be indestructible. With more data captured than any other meter, the Stratus IQ is fanatical about collecting—and protecting—information.</p>
            <p>Oh, yeah, and you’ll be able to create a bill.</p>
